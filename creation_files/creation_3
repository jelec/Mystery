We were underground from the war for about 8 months. Thats a long time! 
Its an incredible feat for everyone to have survived, to be entirely honest. 
In war, you never know what could happen next.

Given we were all here together, 
how did being away from civilisation for 8 long months feel to you?

1. Like a dream, 8 months of holidays!
2. I thought it was quite boring. Theres only so many times you can read the same books.
3. It felt quite hopeless. Most of the time I was worried I wouldn't make it out of here.
4. I don't really have an opinion
